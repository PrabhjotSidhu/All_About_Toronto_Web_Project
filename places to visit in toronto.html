	<main>
			<p> Toronto, the capital of Ontario, is the largest city in Canada and also one of the most diverse. 
			It's home to a dynamic mix of tourist attractions, from museums and galleries to the world famous CN Tower
			and, just offshore, Toronto Islands. And just a short drive away is Niagara Falls.
	        Visitors will find no shortage of things to do, from the vibrant Entertainment District,
			featuring the latest musicals and fine dining, to the historic Distillery District, home to
			unique shops and restaurants with al fresco dining, all set in incredibly restored buildings.</p>
			
			
			
			
			<h2>CN Tower </h2>
			
			<img src="images/cntower.jpg" id="img1" width="500px" height="300px">
			
			<p> Toronto's famous landmark, the 553-meter CN Tower, is one of the city's must see attractions and also the most impossible to miss.
			Towering above the downtown, this Canadian icon can be seen from almost everywhere in the city. You have the option of simply appreciating the 
			building from the ground, or taking a trip up to one of the observation areas or restaurants for fabulous views over the city and Lake Ontario. The CN Tower,
			built between 1972 and 1976, was once the tallest freestanding structure in the world, but has long since been surpassed.The highest viewing area on the CN Tower is from 
			the Sky Pod at 447 meters above the city, with views that, on clear days, extend to Niagara Falls and New York State. </p>
			
			
			
			
			<br><br><h2> The Royal Ontario Museum </h2>
			
			<img src="images/rom.jpg" id="img2" width="500px" height="300px">
			
			<p> The Royal Ontario Museum, known as the ROM, is one of Canada's premier museums, with an international reputation for excellence. It houses an outstanding collection, 
			which covers natural history, art, and culture from a great variety of periods from all over the world. 
			It is also well-known for featuring exhibitions from across the globe.</p>


			
			
			
			
			<br><br><h2> Day Trip to Naigara Falls  </h2>
			
			<img src="images/nfalls.jpg" id="img3" width="500px" height="300px">
			
			<p> A quick day trip from Toronto to Niagara Falls is well worth the time. You can be standing on the edge of the 
			falls in just over an hour. A tour to Niagara Falls from Toronto is an easy way to see the falls if you don't want to drive yourself.
			Tours offer hotel pickup and drop-off and include a Hornblower Niagara Cruise, which takes you up close to 
			the wall of water tumbling that is the main Horseshoe Falls. </p>
			
			
			
			
			<br><br><h2> City Hall & Nathan Philips Square </h2>
			
			<img src="images/cityhall.jpg" id="img4" width="500px" height="300px">
			
			<p> Dominating the spacious Nathan Philips Square with its bronze sculpture, The Archer, by Henry Moore,
			is the still highly acclaimed new City Hall. It was designed by the gifted Finnish architect Viljo Revell and built in 1965.
			City Hall consists of two arc-shaped high-rise blocks, 20 and 27 stories high respectively, wrapped around a lower central building
			topped by a flattened cupola. In the square in front of City Hall is a man-made pond, which becomes a popular 
			skating rink in winter and is where the often photographed Toronto sign is located.
			This is a beautiful area to visit in December, particularly at night, when it's decorated for the Christmas holidays. </p>
			
			
			
			
			<br><br><h2> Toronto Islands </h2>
			
			<img src="images/tislands.jpg" id="img5" width="500px" height="300px">
			
			<p> The ferry trip from Queen's Quay Terminal to the Toronto Islands, about a kilometer offshore, is the prelude to a thoroughly enjoyable outing. <br>
			 There are lovely walks on the islands, as well as the opportunity for rowing, sailing, swimming, and other outdoor activities.<br>
			The Centreville Amusement Park is located on Centre Island, one of the Toronto Islands, and features a variety of children's rides. </p>
